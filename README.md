# STSHeuristicsMod
 Heuristic rating based deck tracking mod for Slay the spire. 
 Upon viewing card reward screen, displays average ratings for cards in deck and displays ratings for offered cards.
 Upon adding a card to your deck, updates and displays the new average.
 
# Installation
Copy the .csv and .jar to your Slay the spire "mod" folder inside the installation directory. 
Launch the game "with mods" from steam and check the mod to activate it.

# Development
Currently uses console as interface instead of in-game gui elements. That should be fixed.
Support should be added for similar behaviour upon entering shops.
